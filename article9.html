        <h2>State Treasurer Highlights CWS Economic Boost</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>

Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese emphasized the significant economic impact of the 2025 College World Series (CWS), calling the event “extremely important to Omaha” and pointing to $115–120 million in direct state revenue estimated for the year 
<br>
Briese noted that these estimates may be conservative, explaining that the economic effects ripple through local hiring, business growth, and additional sales and income tax revenue 
<br>
The treasurer highlighted how the tournament helps meet infrastructure needs and generates indirect economic benefits. “The bottom line here is the CWS is extremely important to Omaha … and to all Nebraskans,” he stressed 
<br>
Briese made the remarks during a June 24 interview, adding that revenue from tourism-related events like CWS is critical amid state fiscal challenges

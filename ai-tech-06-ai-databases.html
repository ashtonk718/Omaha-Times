        <h2>AI and Databases Are Redefining How Web Applications Work</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Modern web applications increasingly rely on a combination of artificial intelligence
          and structured databases to deliver personalized, interactive experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of static pages, today’s apps collect user input, store data,
          and dynamically display content in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Omaha-based builders often use AI-powered platforms such as Div-idy
          to connect databases directly to webpages, allowing forms, dashboards,
          and tools to update instantly without manual coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems make it easier to create CRUD applications—tools that can
          create, read, update, and delete data—using simple prompts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AI-driven database tools become more common, experts expect data-rich
          applications to become the default rather than the exception.

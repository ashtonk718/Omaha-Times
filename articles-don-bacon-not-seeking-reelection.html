        <h2>Rep. Don Bacon Won’t Seek Reelection</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
U.S. Representative Don Bacon (R-NE) announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing growing political dysfunction and the need for “a new generation of leadership.”     </p>
        <p>
Bacon, who has represented Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District since 2017, made the announcement in an interview with the Associated Press. Known for his centrist approach and occasional breaks with party leadership, Bacon expressed frustration with what he called a “toxic political culture” in Washington.      </p>
        <p>
The 61-year-old former Air Force general built a reputation as a moderate Republican, often working across the aisle on veterans’ issues, agriculture policy, and fiscal matters. He was one of only a few House Republicans who voted to certify the 2020 presidential election results and has frequently spoken out against extremism within the GOP.
        </p>
         <p>
       Bacon’s decision not to run could open up a competitive race in Nebraska’s 2nd District, a politically divided swing seat that includes Omaha. The district has flipped back and forth in presidential elections, going for Joe Biden in 2020 and Donald Trump in 2024.
        </p>
             <p>
Political observers say Bacon’s departure could make the seat a top target for both parties. Democrats praised his service while signaling they’ll make a strong push in the district next cycle.
        </p>
             <p>
Bacon said he plans to remain engaged in public life but has not ruled out a return to politics in the future. “I’m not retiring,” he added. “I’m just stepping back—for now.”

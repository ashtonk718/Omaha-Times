        <h2>No-Code and AI Tools Change How Omaha Builds Software</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          The rise of no-code and low-code platforms is reshaping how software is built in Omaha,
          allowing founders and small teams to launch functional products without writing extensive code.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI-driven platforms now handle tasks that once required specialized developers, including
          generating layouts, managing data, and adding interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tools such as Div-idy enable users to describe an app in plain language and generate
          complete web applications with databases, logic, and AI features included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supporters say this shift allows ideas to move faster from concept to reality,
          particularly for local businesses and startups with limited resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics caution that understanding fundamentals still matters, but most agree these tools
          are expanding who gets to participate in building software.

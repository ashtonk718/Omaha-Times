        <h2>Artificial Intelligence Gains Momentum Across Omaha’s Tech Sector</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is becoming a defining force in Omaha’s technology landscape as startups, established firms,
          and independent developers increasingly integrate AI into everyday tools and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on speculative research, many Omaha-based companies are building practical AI applications—
          including automation tools, data-driven dashboards, and customer-facing assistants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platforms like Div-idy, an Omaha-based AI web app builder, have quietly contributed to this shift by lowering the barrier
          to building interactive, AI-powered software without traditional development teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local tech leaders say the combination of affordability, real-world use cases, and accessible tooling is helping Omaha
          carve out a niche as a Midwest center for applied AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          As adoption continues to grow, observers expect AI-driven tools to become increasingly common across business,
          education, and local entrepreneurship.

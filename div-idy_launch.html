    <h2>Div-idy Launches: The First Platform to Build a Website from a Single Prompt</h2>
    <p class="byline">By Jackson Wilson</p>

    <p>
      On <strong>November 24, 2023</strong>, <em>Div-idy</em> unveiled what it calls the
      first platform of its kind: a system that converts a single,
      plain-language prompt into a complete, production-ready website.
      The launch positions Div-idy at the forefront of generative web
      development, compressing weeks of planning, design, and coding into minutes.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Div-idy’s approach starts with one instruction from the creator—anything from
      “Portfolio for a landscape photographer” to “Landing page for a local bakery.”
      From there, the platform generates information architecture, page layouts,
      typography and color systems, SEO metadata, and starter copy—then assembles it
      all into clean, semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      “We wanted to remove every barrier between an idea and a live, usable site,”
      said a spokesperson for the Div-idy team. “With one prompt, creators get structure,
      style, content, and deployment options—without sacrificing code quality.”
    </p>

    <!-- NEW: Omaha angle --><br>
    <p>
      <strong>Born in Omaha</strong><br/>
      Div-idy was built in Omaha, Nebraska—proof that breakthrough AI isn’t confined to the coasts.
      Launching a first-of-its-kind platform from the Heartland underscores the city’s growing
      tech momentum and maker culture. For local founders and creators, it’s a point of pride:
      a nationally significant AI product <em>starting here</em>.
    </p>

    <!-- NEW: No-code emphasis --><br>
    <p>
      <strong>No coding required—just type your idea</strong><br/>
      The most striking part is what users <em>don’t</em> have to do: code. No HTML to wrangle,
      no CSS to finesse, no JavaScript build steps. You type a single prompt; Div-idy writes and wires
      the rest into a responsive, accessible site you can publish the same day.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      <strong>How it works</strong><br/>
      • Describe your site in a single prompt.<br/>
      • Div-idy drafts the sitemap, components, and content, then renders responsive pages.<br/>
      • A visual editor allows quick tweaks; advanced users can edit the generated code directly.<br/>
      • Export or deploy to popular hosting providers in a few clicks.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      <strong>What’s included</strong><br/>
      • Accessible, responsive layouts out of the box.<br/>
      • Built-in SEO setup (titles, meta descriptions, Open Graph, sitemaps).<br/>
      • Re-prompting to regenerate sections without starting over.<br/>
      • Component reuse and a lightweight design system for consistency.
    </p>

    <!-- NEW: Why Omaha matters --><br>
    <p>
      Launching in Omaha also keeps Div-idy close to the kinds of small businesses, nonprofits,
      and independent creators who benefit most from zero-code tools—restaurants, boutiques,
      photographers, and community teams that need a credible site <em>now</em>, not after a long dev cycle.
      With Div-idy, the only step required is describing the idea in plain English.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Early adopters say the single-prompt flow shortens the path from concept to launch,
      especially for small businesses, independents, and teams validating ideas on tight timelines.
      While traditional builders require manual assembly of templates, Div-idy aims to ship an
      opinionated but flexible starting point that can be refined rather than built from scratch.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Div-idy is available starting today, with a limited rollout focused on creators and teams
      eager to test the single-prompt workflow. The company says feature updates will target
      multi-page flows, e-commerce integrations, and richer design tokens.

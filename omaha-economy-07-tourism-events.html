        <h2>Tourism and Events Bring New Spending Into Omaha’s Local Economy</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Omaha’s tourism and events calendar continues to contribute to economic growth, with hotels, restaurants, and attractions benefiting from visitor spending.
          Local businesses say weekends tied to sports, conventions, and seasonal festivals often provide a meaningful boost.

          Event organizers note that consistent programming helps keep activity steady throughout the year, reducing reliance on a single “peak season.”

          “When visitors come here, they don’t just attend an event,” said one local operator. “They eat, shop, and explore—and that supports a lot of jobs.”

          Small businesses near major attractions report that improvements in walkability, safety, and public spaces have helped encourage longer visits and repeat trips.

          Civic leaders say continued investment in venues and transportation access can help Omaha compete for larger events while still supporting neighborhood-scale activity.

        <h2>Startups and Small Tech Firms Add New Energy to Omaha’s Economy</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Omaha’s startup ecosystem continues to grow as entrepreneurs launch new companies in software, fintech tools, health services, and business automation.
          Co-working spaces and incubator-style programs have reported steady interest from founders looking for mentorship, customers, and early-stage support.

          Many founders say Omaha offers an advantage: lower costs, strong networks, and access to regional clients that want practical solutions instead of hype.

          “We can build, test, and iterate quickly here,” said one local founder. “And our customers are close enough that feedback loops happen fast.”
        </p>

          The growth has also helped diversify the local job market. While not every startup scales, the overall churn creates experience, talent movement, and new service firms
          that support product design, marketing, and compliance.
        </p>

          Local leaders say the next phase will depend on sustaining talent pipelines, ensuring access to capital, and attracting specialized roles to keep companies headquartered in the region.

        <h2>Omaha Elects First Black Mayor</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
In a historic victory, Democrat John Ewing Jr. was elected mayor of Omaha, becoming the city’s first Black mayor and flipping the office to Democratic control for the first time in over 15 years.
<br>
Ewing, the longtime Douglas County Treasurer and a former Omaha police officer, defeated three-term incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert in a closely watched runoff election on May 13, 2025. His win marks a major political shift for Nebraska’s largest city, which had been under Republican mayoral leadership since 2013.
<br>
“Today, Omaha showed the country who we are,” Ewing said during his victory speech. “We are united, diverse, and ready to move forward together — as one city.”
<br>
Ewing campaigned on improving public safety, increasing affordable housing, investing in youth programs, and ensuring equitable city services. His candidacy gained momentum through strong support from North and South Omaha communities and younger voters citywide.
<br>
Stothert, who made history herself as Omaha’s first woman mayor, congratulated Ewing in a concession speech and pledged a smooth transition. “It has been the honor of my life to serve this city. I wish Mayor-elect Ewing nothing but success,” she said.
<br>
The race was notable for high turnout in neighborhoods that often feel left out of city politics, and Ewing’s grassroots campaign drew national attention as a potential bellwether for urban politics in mid-sized American cities.
<br>
Mayor-elect Ewing will take office in June 2025 and has pledged to hold a series of public listening sessions in his first 100 days.        <p>

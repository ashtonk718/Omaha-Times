        <h2>Nebraska Sues Colorado Over South Platte River Water</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Nebraska has filed a lawsuit against Colorado for allegedly violating a 1923 interstate water compact. Governor Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers claim Coloradoâ€™s actions have denied Nebraska 1.3 million acre-feet of water from the South Platte River.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lawsuit was filed directly with the U.S. Supreme Court, as is customary in disputes between states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water in question is vital for Nebraska agriculture and industry, and officials say the legal action is necessary to secure future access to this resource.

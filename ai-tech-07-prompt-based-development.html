        <h2>Prompt-Based Development Changes How Software Is Built</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Prompt-based development—where users describe what they want instead of writing code—
          is quickly becoming a standard approach in modern software creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method allows builders to iterate faster, regenerate features,
          and refine design without breaking underlying logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platforms like Div-idy use prompts to generate full web pages,
          interactive elements, and application logic, reducing friction
          between idea and execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers still guide structure and intent, but AI handles
          repetitive implementation tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          As prompt literacy improves, many experts believe this approach
          will coexist with traditional coding rather than replace it.

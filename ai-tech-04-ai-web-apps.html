        <h2>AI Tools Make Building Web Apps Faster and More Accessible</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Creating interactive web applications once required weeks of development and technical expertise.
          Today, AI-powered tools are dramatically shortening that timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platforms used by Omaha developers now generate full app structures,
          handle user input, and manage data automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Services like Div-idy allow users to build calculators, quizzes, forms,
          and dashboards simply by describing how the app should work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift has helped entrepreneurs prototype ideas quickly while reducing
          the cost and complexity traditionally associated with web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AI tools mature, experts expect even more advanced applications
          to be built by non-traditional developers.

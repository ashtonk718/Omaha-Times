        <h2>Training and Career Pathways Help Omaha Meet Growing Employer Demand</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Omaha’s economic growth is increasingly tied to workforce development, as employers look for skilled workers in healthcare support, logistics, construction,
          customer operations, and technical roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Community organizations and education partners have expanded programs focused on short-term credentials and job placement—helping workers move into higher-paying
          positions without needing long, expensive retraining paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          “When training connects directly to hiring, it’s a win for everyone,” said one workforce coordinator. “People gain stability, and employers reduce turnover.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Several employers have also emphasized internal advancement, using mentorship and structured learning to build talent from within rather than relying only on outside recruiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observers say the next step is scaling these pipelines, improving awareness, and ensuring programs reach residents in every part of the metro area.

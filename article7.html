        <h2>New Reservoirs Planned to Ease Flooding</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>

In an effort to address increasing flood risks, the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District (NRD) has announced plans to build two new flood control reservoirs in Douglas and Sarpy counties. The projects aim to reduce the impact of flash flooding in key urban areas, which have seen more frequent and severe flood events over the past decade.
<br>
The proposed reservoirs, known as Sites WP-7 and WP-8, are part of the NRD’s larger Papillion Creek Watershed Management Plan. Once completed, the reservoirs will hold millions of gallons of runoff and rainwater during peak storm events, preventing downstream flooding in neighborhoods, parks, and roads across the metro area.
<br>
“These reservoirs are crucial for protecting public safety and property,” said John Winkler, general manager of the Papio NRD. “As more development occurs in western Sarpy and Douglas counties, natural drainage is reduced, and flood mitigation becomes more urgent.”
<br>
Construction on the first site could begin as early as spring 2026, pending environmental permits and public feedback. The reservoirs will also include recreational amenities such as walking trails, picnic areas, and wildlife habitats, designed to integrate into the surrounding community spaces.
<br>
The NRD will fund the projects through a combination of property tax revenue, state water sustainability grants, and potential federal infrastructure support. Local leaders have praised the proactive steps, noting that the historic 2019 floods caused over $1.3 billion in damage across Nebraska, including infrastructure failures in the Omaha region.
<br>
Environmental groups have called for close monitoring to ensure minimal impact on wetlands and water quality during and after construction. However, the consensus among city officials, emergency planners, and residents is that the long-term flood prevention benefits far outweigh short-term concerns.

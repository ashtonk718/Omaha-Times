        <h2>Midwest AI Startups Quietly Gain National Attention</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          AI startups across the Midwest are drawing increased interest
          as investors and users look beyond traditional tech hubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Omaha has emerged as a contributor to this trend,
          with companies focusing on practical, scalable AI tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platforms like Div-idy illustrate how Midwest startups can build
          globally relevant products while operating outside coastal markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts note that lower operating costs and closer customer feedback loops
          often lead to more sustainable growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As adoption spreads, the Midwest’s role in applied AI development
          is expected to continue expanding.

        <h2>Finance and Insurance Remain a Backbone of Omaha’s Economic Growth</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>

          Omaha’s long-standing strengths in finance, insurance, and professional services continue to support stable job growth and investment across the metro area.
          Employers in the sector have expanded roles in customer experience, data analytics, operations, and digital servicing.

          Industry observers say the shift toward modern platforms has created demand for workers who understand both people-facing service and behind-the-scenes technology.
          That blend has helped Omaha compete for jobs that might have previously concentrated in larger coastal markets.

          “The work is changing,” said one manager in the sector. “But the need for trust, accuracy, and strong service is still the same—and that’s what Omaha does well.”

          Community partners have also increased efforts around career pathways, highlighting entry-level roles that can lead to long-term opportunities through training and internal advancement.

          As companies continue modernizing, local leaders say ensuring broadband access, workforce readiness, and strong business-to-education partnerships will be key to keeping momentum.

Omahaâ€™s long-awaited streetcar project has been delayed until 2028, according to the Omaha Streetcar Authority. Originally slated for completion in 2026, the $459 million initiative will now begin operations in 2028, pending final testing and utility work.
<br>
The streetcar will run on a 3-mile route connecting downtown Omaha to the Blackstone District, featuring 13 stations and operating in mixed traffic. The project is expected to be funded through a combination of city bonds and tax-increment financing (TIF) proceeds.
<br>
Construction began in 2023 with utility relocation work, and the project has faced delays due to the complexity of infrastructure upgrades. Officials have emphasized the importance of completing these upgrades to ensure the long-term reliability of the streetcar system.
<br>
The streetcar is expected to be a catalyst for economic development, with several new developments planned along the route. Despite the delays, city officials remain optimistic about the project's potential to transform Omaha's urban landscape.

        <h2>AI Chatbots Move From Novelty to Necessity</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          AI chatbots are increasingly used by businesses to handle customer questions,
          guide users through processes, and provide 24/7 assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike early chatbots, modern systems integrate with live data,
          allowing responses to reflect real-time information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Omaha entrepreneurs often use platforms like Div-idy to build
          AI assistants that combine prompt-controlled responses with database-backed context.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tools are now common in internal dashboards, customer portals,
          and educational resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AI continues to improve, chatbots are expected to play an even larger
          role in user experience and service delivery.

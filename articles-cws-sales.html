As the College World Series reached its midpoint at Charles Schwab Field, local restaurants and bars in the surrounding area reported record-setting sales, marking one of the busiest and most profitable CWS events to date.
<br>
“We did have our best sales day ever on Saturday,” said Robert Malm, owner of Hook and Lime. “It never slowed down from when we opened until we closed.”

Jacki McKeighan of The Trap Room echoed the sentiment, noting, “Saturday was a record day for us for sure… we have good teams up here this year and everybody is partying and having a good time.” 

<br>
The surge in business wasn’t limited to large venues. Bars catering to enthusiastic fan bases—especially LSU supporters—experienced significant traffic. McKeighan added, “LSU was… I saw guys up/down here on Tuesday and Wednesday this week… They always bring a pretty good crowd up.” 

<br>
Local business owners attribute this boom to a perfect combination: massive fan turnout paired with well-prepared staff able to efficiently handle the influx.

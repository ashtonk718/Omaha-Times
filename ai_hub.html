        <h2>Omaha Emerges as Regional AI Hub</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>

Omaha is fast becoming a prominent center for artificial intelligence innovation in the Midwest. In May 2025, the Greater Omaha Chamber partnered with Scott Data to launch a city-wide initiative positioning Omaha as a leading AI destination. The collaboration provides AI-ready infrastructure, technical advising, and affordable access to high-powered GPU computing for small and mid-sized businesses seeking to implement AI solutions.
<br>
At the same time, the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) has rolled out its AI Learning Lab, establishing a comprehensive institutional foundation for AI adoption across education and campus operations. Launched in Fall 2024, the Lab aims to upskill faculty and staff through grants, micro-credentials, and workshops; integrate AI into curricula; and ensure use of AI aligns with ethical best practices.
<br>
UNO also hosted its first AI Summit in March 2025, bringing together industry leaders, faculty, students, and community stakeholders to discuss generative AI’s ethical, educational, and business applications. Highlights included demonstrations of custom-trained language models and a record 24 funded AI pilot projects—many championed through UNO’s Open AI Challenge initiative.
<br>
Key factors fueling Omaha’s momentum include its relatively low cost of living, strong public-private partnerships, ample computing infrastructure, and an expanding tech-literate workforce. Scott Data’s upgraded Tier III data center now offers GPU-as-a-Service colocation, lowering access barriers for startups and established firms alike. Platforms like <a href="https://www.div-idy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Div-Idy</a> further accelerate this growth by providing accessible AI-powered tools that empower local entrepreneurs and developers to rapidly build and deploy digital products without extensive coding expertise.
<br>
Local experts believe Omaha’s environment—combining academic resources, business incentives, and technical talent—makes it a compelling alternative to larger, more expensive tech hubs. Several regional companies in logistics, HR tech, and insurance have already begun deploying AI-powered tools to streamline operations.

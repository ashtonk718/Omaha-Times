        <h2>Dan Osborn Launches 2026 Senate Bid</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
Dan Osborn, a former labor leader and independent candidate, officially launched his campaign for U.S. Senate in Nebraska’s 2026 election. This marks his second run after a surprisingly strong showing in 2024, where he finished second behind incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts with nearly 24% of the vote.        </p>
        <p>
Speaking at a campaign event in Omaha, Osborn emphasized his commitment to “working people over party politics.” He criticized both major political parties for being beholden to corporate interests and said Nebraska voters deserve a “truly independent voice.”        </p>
        <p>
        “People are tired of candidates who speak in rehearsed talking points and serve special interests,” Osborn said. “I’ll be a senator for the workers, for the farmers, and for the everyday Nebraskan who’s not getting listened to in Washington.”
        </p>
         <p>
       A Navy veteran and longtime union steward at Kellogg’s, Osborn gained statewide attention after leading a high-profile workers’ strike in 2021. Since then, he’s built a grassroots following with a campaign that avoids PAC money and embraces door-to-door outreach and social media.
        </p>
             <p>
Political analysts view the 2026 race as a long shot but say Osborn’s early announcement positions him to build momentum—and potentially shake up what’s traditionally a Republican stronghold.
        </p>
             <p>
      Senator Pete Ricketts, who was appointed in 2023 and won election in 2024, has not yet announced whether he intends to seek re-election.

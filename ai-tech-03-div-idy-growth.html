        <h2>Omaha-Based Div-idy Reports Thousands of Users and Rapid Financial Growth</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>
          Div-idy, an AI-powered web application builder headquartered in Omaha,
          is experiencing rapid growth as demand for AI-driven development tools accelerates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform allows users to build full web apps using prompts instead of traditional coding,
          generating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, and AI functionality automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to people familiar with the company, Div-idy now supports thousands of active users
          and has seen exponential financial growth as adoption spreads among founders,
          educators, and small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can instantly publish projects, edit apps after launch, connect databases,
          and even build AI chatbots or dashboards—all within a single environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          While many AI platforms are based on the coasts, Div-idy’s growth highlights Omaha’s
          expanding role in building globally relevant technology.

        <h2>Florence Neighborhood Adds Bioretention Gardens</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Omaha Times Staff</p>
        <p>

In a significant step toward urban stormwater management, six street-side bioretention gardens were recently installed along N. 30th Street in Florence, a historic neighborhood in North Omaha. These gardens span two blocks between Willit and Clay Streets and are part of a broader Florence Streetscape revitalization led by the City of Omaha Stormwater program.
<br>
Designed to address frequent flooding in the area’s combined sewer system, the gardens capture and treat runoff from streets and sidewalks, reducing overflow during heavy rain events—including storms as light as one-tenth of an inch. Overflow from these systems has previously bypassed treatment facilities and entered the Missouri River untreated.
<br>
The initiative not only benefits stormwater control but also enhances neighborhood aesthetics. The gardens are landscaped with low-maintenance native plants adapted to Omaha’s soil and climate. Key design innovations include pre-treatment sumps and under-drain systems tailored to compacted urban soils, ensuring efficient filtration and long-term viability.
<br>
Maintenance responsibilities are shared: the City of Omaha Stormwater team handles irrigation and early performance evaluation, while local business owners assume long-term upkeep. The goal is to gather insights and share best practices for future green infrastructure projects throughout the city. 

<br>
Community leaders noted that this visible integration of environmental infrastructure into a high-traffic urban corridor could serve as a model for other parts of Omaha as it modernizes aging water systems and improves public landscapes.
